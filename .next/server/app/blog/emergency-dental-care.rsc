      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Hospital Emergency Rooms</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Emergency rooms <strong>cannot</strong> perform dental work, but they can:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Prescribe antibiotics for infection</li>
        <li>Prescribe pain medication</li>
        <li>Stabilize you if the infection is spreading</li>
        <li>Treat facial trauma</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Under EMTALA, hospitals <strong>must stabilize you regardless of ability to pay</strong>. They'll bill you later, and you may qualify for charity care or financial assistance programs.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        FQHCs offer sliding-scale fees and <strong>typically have same-day emergency appointments</strong>. Call and say it's an emergency—they'll work you in.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Find FQHCs at <a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov" class="text-blue-600 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov</a> or call 1-877-464-4772.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Dental Schools</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Dental schools have emergency clinics and charge <strong>50-70% less</strong> than private practices. Call early in the day—emergency slots fill up fast.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Use our <a href="/school-finder" class="text-blue-600 underline">School Finder tool</a> to locate dental schools near you.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4. Urgent Care Centers with Dental Services</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Some urgent care centers employ dentists or can handle basic dental emergencies. Call ahead to ask.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What to Say When You Call</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When you call a dental office in pain, how you communicate matters. Use these scripts:
      </p>

      <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-5 my-6">
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Script 1: When You Can't Pay the Full Price</strong></p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 italic">"I have a dental emergency and I'm in a lot of pain. I don't have dental insurance and money is very tight right now. Do you offer any payment plans or discounts for patients paying out of pocket? I can pay [amount] today."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-5 my-6">
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Script 2: Asking for the Lowest-Cost Option</strong></p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 italic">"I'm calling about a dental emergency. I know I need treatment but I have a very limited budget. What's the least expensive option to address this problem? I just need to be out of pain."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-5 my-6">
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Script 3: For a Knocked-Out Tooth</strong></p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 italic">"I just knocked out a tooth and I understand this is time-sensitive. Can you see me immediately? I'm concerned about the cost—is there a payment plan available?"</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Pain Management Until You Can See a Dentist</h2>

      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-4 my-6">
        <p class="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Important:</p>
        <p class="text-blue-800">These are temporary measures. Pain is a sign that something is wrong. You still need professional treatment.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">For Toothache Pain</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>OTC pain relievers:</strong> Ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) work well together. Alternate every 3 hours (if you have no medical contraindications).</li>
        <li><strong>Cold compress:</strong> Apply an ice pack to the outside of your face for 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off.</li>
        <li><strong>Saltwater rinse:</strong> Mix 1/2 teaspoon salt in 8 oz warm water. Swish and spit.</li>
        <li><strong>Clove oil:</strong> Apply a tiny amount to the painful area with a cotton ball (natural numbing effect).</li>
        <li><strong>Elevate your head:</strong> Sleep with extra pillows—lying flat increases blood pressure and pain.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">For Swelling</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Cold compress:</strong> Ice helps reduce swelling</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid heat:</strong> Heat can make infections worse</li>
        <li><strong>Seek care immediately:</strong> Swelling can spread and become dangerous</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">For a Knocked-Out Tooth (Time is Critical!)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Find the tooth:</strong> Hold it by the crown (the top), not the root</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse gently:</strong> Don't scrub—just rinse off dirt</li>
        <li><strong>Try to reinsert:</strong> Gently place it back in the socket (correct direction)</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it moist:</strong> If you can't reinsert, put it in milk or saliva (NOT water)</li>
        <li><strong>Get help within 30 minutes:</strong> The sooner, the better the chance of saving it</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">If You're Referred Elsewhere</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Some dental emergencies require specialists (like oral surgeons). If this happens to you:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Ask for a referral to a low-cost option:</strong> "Is there an oral surgeon who works with uninsured patients or offers payment plans?"</li>
        <li><strong>Ask about treatment centers:</strong> Some hospitals have dental residency programs with lower fees</li>
        <li><strong>Call the specialist directly:</strong> Explain your situation and ask about payment options before agreeing to the appointment</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Hospital Charity Care</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If you visit an ER for a dental emergency and receive a large bill:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Ask about charity care or financial assistance</li>
        <li>Most non-profit hospitals have programs for low-income patients</li>
        <li>You may qualify for a reduced bill or payment plan</li>
        <li>Call the hospital's billing department and ask about "financial assistance"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Use Our Emergency Triage Tool</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">

      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Dental emergencies are stressful enough without worrying about money. <strong>You have options</strong>—from hospital ERs (for infections) to FQHCs to dental schools. Don't let cost prevent you from seeking care when you're in pain.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The key is knowing where to call and what to say. Use the scripts above, and don't be afraid to be honest about your financial situation.
