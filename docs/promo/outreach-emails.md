## 1. FQHCs / Community Health Centers

**Subject:** Free Dental Navigation Resource for Your Patients

Dear [Contact Person or "Community Health Team"],

I'm reaching out to share a free resource that could benefit the patients you serve who struggle with dental care access. Dental Guide (https://dental-guide-eta.vercel.app) is a no-cost tool designed to help uninsured and underinsured individuals navigate affordable dental care options.

**What Dental Guide Offers Your Patients:**

- **Negotiation Scripts**: Ready-to-use scripts for discussing payment options and discounts with dental providers
- **Dental School Finder**: Location-based search for affordable dental school clinics (often 50-70% less than private practices)
- **Cost Estimator**: Transparent pricing information to help patients plan and budget
- **Emergency Triage Guide**: Immediate guidance for dental emergencies when care isn't accessible
- **Community Clinic Finder**: Directory of low-cost and sliding-scale clinics

Many community health center patients are unaware that dental negotiation is possible or that dental schools provide quality care at reduced rates. Dental Guide fills this information gap with practical, actionable tools.

**How to Share:**

We would be grateful if you would consider:
- Adding Dental Guide to your patient resources webpage
- Including the link in printed patient education materials
- Sharing with your social services team

There is no cost to your organization or your patients. This is purely a community resource designed to help people access the dental care they need.

If you have any questions or would like more information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## 3. Catholic Charities & Social Service Organizations

**Subject:** Resource to Help Clients Access Affordable Dental Care

Dear [Contact Person or "Program Team"],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to share a resource that may serve the clients and families you support. Dental Guide (https://dental-guide-eta.vercel.app) is a free, faith-neutral tool designed to help individuals facing financial hardship access necessary dental care.

**The Challenge Many Families Face:**

Many of the families you serve may be forced to choose between dental treatment and other basic needs. Dental pain affects nutrition, sleep, work, and overall wellbeing—yet affordable options are often difficult to find.

**How Dental Guide Helps:**

**Why This Matters:**

Dignity is central to the mission of service. When individuals can't access dental care, it affects their confidence, employment prospects, and social participation. Dental Guide helps restore some of that dignity by providing practical tools to navigate a difficult system.

**No Cost, No Catch:**

- 100% free for users and organizations
- No advertising or data collection
- No registration required
- Available in English and Spanish (with more languages planned)
