## Post 1: r/povertyfinance

**Title:** I built a free tool to help negotiate dental bills and find affordable care - saved myself $2,000+

**Body:**

After getting hit with a $4,200 quote for a root canal I couldn't afford, I spent weeks researching every possible way to get dental care on a budget. What I learned was so valuable that I built a free website to share it with others who are struggling.

The reality is that dental prices are often negotiable, but most people don't know how to have that conversation. I created actual **negotiation scripts** you can use - just print them out and read from them. I used the "payment plan" script and got my procedure knocked down to $2,100 with 0% interest monthly payments.

**What the free site includes:**

- **Dental Cost Estimator:** See what procedures *should* cost so you know if you're being overcharged
- **Negotiation Scripts:** Word-for-word scripts for asking for discounts, payment plans, and charity care
- **75 Dental Schools:** Quality care at 30-50% off (students are supervised by licensed dentists)
- **Community Clinic Finder:** 38+ FQHCs with sliding scale fees based on income
- **Emergency Triage Guide:** Figure out what actually needs immediate care vs. what can wait

**Why this matters for our community:**

Dental debt is predatory. If you're uninsured, you're often charged 2-3x what insurance companies pay. But providers *will* work with you if you know how to ask. I've gathered everything in one place so you don't have to spend weeks researching like I did.

No sign-up required, no ads, completely free. Just trying to help others avoid the stress I went through.

Hope this helps someone here save some money.

## Post 2: r/Dental

**Title:** Free Resource: Dental care options for patients who can't afford treatment

**Body:**

Hey everyone - I built a free resource website to help patients find affordable dental care when they're uninsured or underinsured. After seeing too many people delay necessary treatment due to cost, I wanted to create something practical.

**What's included:**

- **Dental School Finder:** 75 accredited schools with contact info and general pricing (typically 30-50% less than private practice)
- **FQHC Locator:** 38+ Federally Qualified Health Centers offering sliding scale fees
- **Cost Estimator:** Helps patients understand typical pricing so they can spot reasonable quotes
- **Negotiation Scripts:** Guidance on how to have productive conversations about payment options
- **Emergency Triage:** Helps patients understand urgency levels to seek appropriate care

**Why I'm sharing:**

As dental professionals, we know that delayed treatment leads to worse outcomes and higher costs long-term. Many patients simply don't know that dental schools and community health centers exist, or that payment plans are often negotiable.

This isn't about undercutting anyone - it's about connecting patients who have no other options with legitimate, quality care providers (dental schools, FQHCs, etc.) and giving them tools to have productive conversations about payment.

Feel free to share with patients who are struggling with costs. Hope this helps bridge the gap for some people.

## Post 3: r/lowincome

**Title:** Free dental care resource - scripts to negotiate bills, find cheap clinics, and estimate costs

**Body:**

I know dental care is one of the hardest things to afford when money is tight. Insurance often doesn't cover dental, and paying out of pocket can feel impossible. After going through this myself, I put together a free website with everything I learned.

**What you'll find:**

**Negotiation Scripts**
- Pre-written scripts you can literally read to your dentist's office
- Scripts for asking about discounts, payment plans, and sliding scale options
- I used one of these to cut my bill in half with a payment plan

**Where to Find Affordable Care**
- **75 Dental Schools:** Quality care at 30-50% off (students supervised by licensed dentists)
- **38+ Community Clinics:** Fees based on what you can afford (sliding scale)
- **Emergency Guide:** Figure out what needs immediate care vs. what can wait

**Cost Estimator**
- See what procedures typically cost so you know if a quote is fair
- Helps you avoid getting overcharged just because you're uninsured

**Emergency Triage**
- Not sure if that toothache is urgent? This guide helps you figure out when you need to go now vs. when it can wait

**No catch:**
- Completely free
- No sign-up or email required
- Just trying to help others in a similar situation

I know how stressful it is to need dental work and not know how you'll pay for it. Hope this helps someone get the care they need without drowning in debt.
