### Post 3: Infographic - The Numbers

**Image:** Bar chart or stat graphic showing:
- "72M Americans without dental insurance"
- "3 in 10 adults delayed care due to cost"
- "Dental schools: 50% cheaper than private practices"
- "Cash payments: Average 25% discount when negotiated"

**Caption:**
The numbers don't lie - dental care is out of reach for too many people.

But here's what nobody tells you: PRICES ARE NEGOTIABLE.

I created Dental Guide to give you the exact scripts that work:
- "If I pay in full today, can you offer a cash discount?"
- "I saw another office offering 20% off for new patients - can you match that?"
- "Do you offer payment plans for this procedure?"

Get these scripts + find dental schools near you (free, no signup) 🔗 Link in bio

### Post 4: Testimonial-Style Graphic

**Image:** Phone mockup showing Dental Guide interface with text overlay:
"I saved $400 on my root canal using one script"

**Caption:**
Real feedback from a Dental Guide user:

"I was quoted $1,800 for a root canal. I used the cash payment script from Dental Guide, asked for a discount for paying in full, and walked out paying $1,400. That's my rent money." - Sarah, 29

This is why I built this tool. Because $400 means groceries. It means utilities. It matters.

- Negotiation scripts for any procedure

- Alternative care guides for pain management & dentures

## 3. TWITTER/X THREADS (3 Threads)

### Thread 1: The "Hidden Options" Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
72 million Americans don't have dental insurance. But nobody tells you about the 3 hidden options for affordable care. A thread 🧵👇

**Tweet 2:**
Option 1: Dental Schools

They offer the same treatments as private offices at 50% off. Students are supervised by licensed dentists. The care is identical. The price is half.

Problem: Most people don't know they exist.

**Tweet 3:**
Solution: Dental Guide (dental-guide-eta.vercel.app)

Type in your ZIP code and it shows you:
✅ Every dental school near you
✅ Phone numbers & websites
✅ What treatments they offer
✅ How to book an appointment

**Tweet 4:**
Option 2: Cash Discounts

Dental offices charge insurance companies $2,000 for a root canal. But they'd rather get $1,400 in cash today than wait months for insurance payouts.

You have leverage. Use it.

**Tweet 5:**
But most people don't know WHAT TO SAY.

Dental Guide gives you the exact script:
"If I pay the full amount today in cash, can you offer a discount? Another office offered 20% off - can you match that?"

Simple words. Real savings.

**Tweet 6:**
Option 3: Payment Plans

Most dental offices offer 0% interest payment plans. They don't advertise it. You have to ask.

Dental Guide's scripts include:
✅ How to ask for payment plans
✅ What terms to negotiate
✅ Backup options if they say no

**Tweet 7:**
The system is broken. Dental care is treated as a luxury, not a basic need.

But tools like Dental Guide help people navigate it without shame.

No signup. No ads. Just practical help.

**Tweet 8:**
Share this thread with someone who needs it. Dental care shouldn't depend on your income.

### Thread 2: The "How to Negotiate" Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I negotiated $600 off my dental bill yesterday. Here's exactly what I said (word for word): 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
First, understand this:

Dentists PREFER cash patients over insurance.

Why? Insurance companies:
❌ Take 90+ days to pay
❌ Reject 20% of claims
❌ Require endless paperwork

Cash patients:
✅ Get paid immediately
✅ No paperwork
✅ Guaranteed revenue

**Tweet 3:**
So I called my dentist and said:

"Hi, I need a root canal. I don't have insurance, so I'd be paying cash upfront. Is there a discount for paying in full today? I've seen other offices offering 20% off for cash payments."

**Tweet 4:**
Her response:

"Yes, we can do 20% off if you pay today."

That's it.

I saved $400 by using ONE sentence from Dental Guide's script generator.

**Tweet 5:**
The script generator is free at dental-guide-eta.vercel.app

You just:
1. Select your treatment (root canal, crown, filling, etc.)
2. Choose your situation (no insurance, high deductible, etc.)
3. Get a personalized script

Takes 30 seconds.

**Tweet 6:**
Here are other scripts that work:

📝 Payment plan request:
"Can we split this into 3 monthly payments with no interest?"

📜 Competitor comparison:
"The office down the street charges $1,200 for this. Can you match that?"

💸 New patient discount:
"Do you offer any discounts for new uninsured patients?"

**Tweet 7:**
Key principles:

✅ Be polite (they're humans too)
✅ Mention you're paying cash upfront
✅ Reference competitor pricing (even if you're bluffing)
✅ Ask about payment plans

These scripts are all available for free at Dental Guide.

**Tweet 8:**
Don't let shame stop you from asking. Dental offices negotiate EVERY DAY - with insurance companies, with suppliers, with labs.

You're just asking for the same treatment they give everyone else.

### Thread 3: The "Dental School" Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I paid $40 for a dental cleaning instead of $120. Here's how (and it's not a hack or loophole): 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
I went to a dental school clinic instead of a private dentist.

Same equipment. Same cleaning. Same supervision.

The only difference: A student did the work (while a licensed dentist watched).

Price: 67% less.

**Tweet 3:**
Here's what nobody tells you:

Dental schools NEED patients. Students are required to complete real treatments before graduating. They're DESPERATE for people to treat.

It's a win-win. You get cheap care. They get experience.

**Tweet 4:**
But finding them is annoying. Each school has different:
- Application processes
- Appointment systems
- Treatment offerings
- Pricing structures

I built a tool to solve this.

**Tweet 5:**
Dental Guide (dental-guide-eta.vercel.app) finds every dental school near your ZIP code.

Shows you:
📍 Location & distance
📞 Phone number
💻 Website
✅ What they offer
📝 How to book

**Tweet 6:**
Is it safe?

YES. Every procedure is:
✅ Supervised by licensed dentists
✅ Performed with the same equipment
✅ Held to the same safety standards
✅ Often MORE careful (students are graded on everything)

**Tweet 7:**
What treatments can you get?

✅ Cleanings ($40-60 vs $120-150)
✅ Fillings ($50-100 vs $150-300)
✅ Crowns ($300-500 vs $800-1,500)
✅ Root canals ($400-700 vs $1,000-2,000)

Prices vary by school, but it's consistently 50-70% less.

**Tweet 8:**
Who is this for?

✅ No insurance
✅ High deductible plans
✅ Between jobs
✅ Students on a budget
✅ Anyone wanting to save money

**Tweet 9:**
Find dental schools near you in 30 seconds:

dental-guide-eta.vercel.app

Type your ZIP code. Get a list of schools. Call and book.

That's it.

No signup. No ads. Just help.

**Tweet 10:**
Share this with someone who's putting off dental work because of cost.

Everyone deserves to smile without going broke.

## 4. LINKEDIN POST (Professional Audience)

**Headline:** Making Healthcare Accessible: A Tool for the 72 Million Americans Without Dental Insurance

**Body:**

Last year, I discovered a troubling statistic: 72 million Americans don't have dental insurance. For many, this means choosing between dental care and rent.

So I built something to help.

**Introducing Dental Guide** - a free tool that helps people access affordable dental care through three core features:

🎯 **Negotiation Script Generator**
Most people don't realize dental prices are negotiable. I've created scripts that help patients ask for cash discounts, payment plans, and competitor price matching. The result? Average savings of 20-30%.

🎓 **Dental School Finder**
Dental schools offer supervised treatments at 50-70% below private practice rates. The challenge? Finding them. This tool matches patients to nearby schools based on ZIP code.

💡 **Alternative Care Guides**
For those managing chronic conditions or waiting for treatment, these guides provide practical lifestyle management tips for denture care, pain management, and more.

**The Impact:**

This isn't about disrupting an industry - it's about bridging an access gap. Users are saving hundreds on single procedures. One recent user reduced their root canal cost from $1,800 to $1,400 using a single script.

**Why I'm Sharing This:**

We need more tools that make healthcare accessible to everyone, regardless of income. If you're in healthcare, tech, or policy - I'd love your thoughts on:

- How can we scale solutions like this?
- What other healthcare access gaps need bridging?
- Are there partnership opportunities with dental schools or community health organizations?

**Try It Out:**
dental-guide-eta.vercel.app

Completely free. No signup required. No ads.

Because everyone deserves access to dental care.
