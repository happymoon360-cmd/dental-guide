### Template 1: Dental Costs/Prices

**Query Type:** Looking for experts on dental costs, affordable dental care

**Pitch:**

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'd love to contribute to your article on [specific topic mentioned in query].

I'm the founder of Dental Guide (https://dental-guide-eta.vercel.app), a free platform I built to help uninsured and underinsured Americans access affordable dental care.

**Relevant insights I can share:**

**Cost data:**
- I've researched 75+ US dental schools and their pricing
- Cost comparison: Private practices charge 50-70% more than dental schools
- Regional cost variations: Northeast (10-15% higher), Midwest (average), South/West (5-10% lower)
- Procedure-specific data for 14 treatments from cleanings ($120 avg) to implants ($5,000 avg)

**Real-world examples:**
- Crown: $3,200 (private) vs $1,200 (school) - 63% savings
- Root canal: $1,200 (private) vs $600 (school) - 50% savings
- Full dentures: $2,500 (private) vs $1,000 (school) - 60% savings

**Expertise:**
- Researched all 66 accredited US dental schools
- Built free tools used by thousands of Americans
- Data sourced from FAIR Health, American Dental Association, CDC

**Why readers care:**
- 65 million Americans don't have dental insurance
- Dental debt is the #1 cause of medical debt in the US
- Most people don't know dental schools exist as affordable alternative
- $140 billion spent annually on preventable dental problems

**What I can provide:**
- Specific cost data by region
- Quotes from real users who saved money
- Expert commentary on why dental costs are so high
- Actionable advice for readers: How to find dental schools, negotiate prices
- Statistics and data points for your article

**Additional context:**
I have a personal connection to this issue - a friend needed a $2,000 root canal, couldn't afford it, let it go for months, ended up in ER costing $3,500. This inspired me to build Dental Guide.

Happy to provide more details, quotes, or connect you with users who have saved money using our tools.

### Template 2: Medical Debt/Healthcare Costs

**Query Type:** Looking for experts on medical debt, healthcare affordability

**Pitch:**

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'd love to contribute to your piece on [specific topic].

I founded Dental Guide (https://dental-guide-eta.vercel.app) to help Americans avoid medical debt from dental care.

**Unique angle I can offer:**

**Dental debt as a case study:**
- Dental debt is the #1 cause of medical debt in the US (per studies)
- Average person with dental debt: $3,000-$6,000
- Many avoid treatment until it becomes emergency (3-10x more expensive)
- Story: Friend needed $2,000 root canal, couldn't afford it, delayed care, ended up in ER for $3,500

**Why dental costs are problematic:**
- No transparency in pricing - most don't know what things "should" cost
- Emergency care often only option when untreated
- Insurance doesn't cover major procedures for many
- Lack of awareness about alternatives (dental schools, FQHCs)

**The solution I built:**
- Free tools to find affordable options
- Cost transparency with regional pricing data
- Negotiation scripts to reduce prices
- 75+ US dental schools in searchable database

**Data I can provide:**
- 65 million uninsured Americans (statistic)
- $140 billion annual preventable dental spending
- 50-70% savings potential at dental schools
- Real user savings stories (names can be anonymous if needed)
- State-by-state dental school coverage

**Actionable advice for readers:**
- How to find dental schools near them
- How to negotiate dental bills (I have word-for-word scripts)
- How to compare prices before committing to treatment
- Alternative options: FQHCs, community clinics, payment plans

**Why this matters now:**
- Inflation increasing all costs, including healthcare
- More Americans losing employer-sponsored dental insurance
- Economic uncertainty makes preventive care harder to afford
- This is a solvable problem with right information

### Template 3: Uninsured/Underinsured Healthcare

**Query Type:** Looking for stories about uninsured Americans, healthcare gaps

**Pitch:**

Hi [Journalist Name],

I can help with your story on [specific topic].

I built Dental Guide (https://dental-guide-eta.vercel.app) specifically to address the gap for uninsured and underinsured Americans seeking dental care.

**What I bring to this conversation:**

**The problem:**
- 65 million Americans don't have dental insurance
- Millions more underinsured (high deductibles, limited coverage)
- 1 in 4 Americans skip necessary dental care due to cost
- Result: $140 billion spent annually on preventable dental problems

**The human story:**
I have a personal connection to this issue. My friend needed a root canal, was quoted $2,000. She didn't have insurance, couldn't afford it. She delayed care for 6 months. The infection spread. She went to the ER. The bill was $3,500.

This is preventable - dental schools would have charged $600 for the same procedure. But she didn't know they existed or how to find one.

**The solution I created:**
Completely free tools to find affordable care:

1. **School Finder:** 75 US dental schools with pricing, services, contact info
2. **Cost Estimator:** Regional cost data for 14 procedures
3. **Script Generator:** Word-for-word negotiation scripts
4. **Emergency Triage:** Medical guidance on when to seek urgent care

**Why it works:**
- No barriers to entry (no signup, free)
- Privacy-first (no data collection)
- Practical action (find schools, compare prices, negotiate)
- Covers gaps where insurance doesn't

**Success stories I can share:**
- User saved $1,800 on crown using negotiation script
- Family saved $3,000 on husband's implants by finding dental school
- User avoided $2,000 ER visit using emergency triage tool
- Names can be anonymous if needed for your piece

**Why this matters:**
- Preventive dental care saves $3,000+ per person annually
- Poor oral health linked to heart disease, diabetes, other conditions
- Financial stress of medical debt affects mental health, job performance
- This is fixable with better information access

**What I can provide:**
- Expert commentary on why this gap exists
- Data and statistics
- Real stories (with user permission)
- Actionable tips for your readers
- Visuals: Screenshots of our free tools

Happy to discuss further or provide specific examples for your article.
