## Hunter Comment Strategy

**Pre-write responses to likely comments:**

Q: "Why not just search Google for dental schools?"
A: "Great question! Google search shows dental schools, but not:
  - Which ones accept patients (some don't)
  - What services they offer and pricing
  - Which take Medicaid/Medicare
  - Whether they have emergency clinics
  We aggregate all this into one searchable database."

Q: "Are dental school procedures safe?"
A: "Absolutely! Every procedure is supervised by licensed dentists who are faculty members. The quality is comparable to private practice. We include this info in our school listings to address this common concern."

Q: "Do you make money from this?"
A: "Nope! Completely free. No ads, no affiliate links, no data collection. Built purely to help people access affordable dental care."

Q: "How many dental schools are in your database?"
A: "We currently list 75 dental schools across the US. Our goal is to add all accredited US dental schools (there are ~66 total) plus community clinics for states without schools."
