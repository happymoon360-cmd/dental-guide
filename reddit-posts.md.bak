**Title:**
I built a free directory of 75 US dental schools to help uninsured Americans save 50-70% on dental care

**Body:**

**TL;DR:** Created a free tool to find accredited dental schools. Saved myself $1,800 on a root canal. Dental schools charge 50-70% less than private practices.

---

**The Problem:**

Last year, my friend needed a root canal. She didn't have insurance. The dentist quoted her $2,000.

She couldn't afford it, so she let it go for months. Eventually, the infection spread and she ended up in the ER - which cost her $3,500.

**The Solution:**

After that, I researched dental schools. Found one 30 miles away. Got the same root canal for $700 (65% savings).

But finding dental schools is hard. Most don't have good websites. You have to call each one to ask:
- Do you accept patients?
- What procedures do you offer?
- What's your pricing?
- Do you take Medicaid?

So I built: **dental.guide/school-finder**

It lists 75 US dental schools with:
- ✅ Services offered
- ✅ Contact information
- ✅ Pricing estimates
- ✅ Medicaid/Medicare acceptance
- ✅ Emergency clinic availability

**Real Savings Examples:**

- Crown: $3,000 (private) → $1,200 (school) = **Save $1,800**
- Root canal: $1,200 (private) → $600 (school) = **Save $600**
- Full dentures: $2,500 (private) → $1,000 (school) = **Save $1,500**

**It's Completely Free:**

- No signup
- No ads
- No data collection
- Just helpful information

**Feedback Appreciated:**

I built this to help people in similar situations. Would love to hear if it's useful, or if there's anything I should add.

**Comments:** Let me know what dental procedures you've had done and how much they cost. I'm trying to build the most accurate pricing database possible.

**Title:**
Free dental cost calculator revealed I'm overpaying by $500+ per procedure

**Body:**

**TL;DR:** Built a free tool to check dental costs in my area. Found I could be paying 50-70% less at dental schools.

---

**Background:**

I've been putting off dental work for years because:
1. I don't have dental insurance through work
2. Private dentist prices are insane
3. No idea what things "should" cost
4. Afraid of getting ripped off

So I spent hours researching:
- Average crown costs in my state
- Which dental schools are nearby
- How to negotiate (unsuccessfully)
- Reviews of local dentists

**Finally Just Built It Myself:**

dental.guide/cost-estimator

Shows you:
- Average prices for 14 dental procedures in your region
- Cost ranges (Northeast, Midwest, South, West)
- Private practice vs. dental school comparison
- What you should expect to pay

**What I Discovered:**

I was being ripped off. Or at least, overpaying significantly.

Example from my area (Midwest):
- Crown: $1,000 (private average)
- Dental school: $500
- **Potential savings: $500**

I need 3 crowns. That's $1,500 I could save.

**The Other Tools I Built:**

1. **School Finder** - Find 75 US dental schools
2. **Script Generator** - Word-for-word scripts to negotiate prices
3. **Emergency Triage** - Is your dental issue urgent?

**Real Example:**

Used the script generator for a filling that was quoted at $350.

Script said to say:
> "I found that dental schools in the area charge $75-150 for this procedure. Can you match that price?"

Dentist: "Sure, we can do $200."

Saved $150 on a filling.

**Why I'm Sharing:**

I know r/personalfinance focuses on bigger money topics (investing, FIRE, side hustles).

But healthcare costs are destroying budgets too.

Dental debt is the #1 cause of medical debt in the US. 65 million Americans don't have dental insurance.

If you've been avoiding the dentist because of cost, check out:
- dental.guide/school-finder
- dental.guide/cost-estimator
- dental.guide/script-builder

All free. No signup.

**Question for the community:**

What's your experience with dental costs? Have you tried negotiating? Used dental schools?

I'm trying to build the most accurate pricing database possible to help others avoid getting ripped off.

## Post 3: r/Frugal Subreddit

**Title:**
I saved $2,000+ on dental care last year using these 3 free tools

**Body:**

**The Strategy:**

Dental work is one of those expenses where most people don't shop around. They just go to their regular dentist and pay whatever.

Bad financial decision.

**My Dental Care Toolkit (All Free):**

**1. Cost Estimator - dental.guide/cost-estimator**

Know what things SHOULD cost before your appointment.

Example: I needed a crown.
- Dentist quoted: $3,200
- Checked estimator: Average in my area is $1,000
- Knew I was being overcharged
- Negotiated down to $1,800
- Still saved $1,400

**2. School Finder - dental.guide/school-finder**

Dental students need patients to practice. They charge 50-70% less.

Trade-offs:
- Takes 2-4 hours instead of 30 minutes
- May need multiple appointments
- But saves hundreds or thousands

I did my last root canal at a school:
- Private would have been: $1,200
- Paid: $600
- **Saved: $600**

**3. Script Generator - dental.guide/script-builder**

Don't know what to say to negotiate? Use these scripts.

Includes templates for:
- Asking for discounts
- Payment plans
- Cash payments
- Hardship situations

Example negotiation using script:
> "I found pricing at local dental schools is 50-70% lower than your quote. Is there any room for adjustment?"

Dentist: "We can do $900."
- Original quote: $1,500
- **Saved: $600**

**Total Saved This Year:**

- Crown negotiation: $1,400
- Root canal at school: $600
- Filling negotiation: $150
- Teeth cleaning at school: $75
- **Total: $2,225**

**Time Investment:**

- Researching prices: 1 hour
- Using tools: 10 minutes
- Negotiating with scripts: 5 minutes
- **Total: 1 hour 15 minutes**

**ROI:** $2,225 / 1.25 hours = **$1,780 per hour**

**The Tools:**

1. dental.guide/school-finder
2. dental.guide/cost-estimator
3. dental.guide/script-builder

Also:
- dental.guide/emergency-triage (is your issue urgent?)

**All Free. No Signup. Privacy First.**
