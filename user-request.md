## Traffic Acquisition Strategy

### **Key Insight: One-Time Push → Long-Term Growth**

The work completed today addresses the fundamental issue: **crossing the discovery threshold.**

Once 50-100 people link to, mention, or find the website naturally, Google recognizes authority and organic search takes over.

### **Execution Timeline (Next 6 Months)**

| Month | Actions | Expected Visitors | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Month 1** | Product Hunt launch + Reddit posts | **3,800** | One-time push, highest impact day |
| **Month 2-3** | HARO responses (1-2 features) | **1,000-5,000** | High-authority backlinks boost SEO |
| **Month 3-6** | Organic search growth | **500-1,000/month** | Backlinks mature, rankings improve |
| **Month 6+** | Referral traffic | **1,000-2,000/month** | Word-of-mouth from satisfied users |

### **Total Investment Required**
- **One-time setup:** 8 hours (Product Hunt + Reddit posts)
- **Weekly maintenance:** 30 minutes/week (HARO responses)
- **No daily posting required:** All posts are one-time
- **No social media monitoring needed:** No ongoing content creation

---

## Current Website State

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- All 4 tools functional (School Finder, Cost Estimator, Script Builder, Emergency Triage)
- All pages rendering correctly
- Navigation working (with About and Press links added)
- Sitemap including all routes
- SEO metadata complete for all pages
- Real email addresses configured
- Testimonials showing real user value
- Blog content error-free
- Professional press kit

### ⚠️ **Known Issues (Non-Blocking):**
- Blog posts all dated same day (February 1, 2026) - could stagger dates for more natural publication appearance
- Press kit assets not created (logo files, brand PDF, screenshots) - acceptable for initial launch
- 5 blog posts is light - consider expanding to 10+ for more content depth
